This zip contains two folders:
- `frontend` — Next.js + Tailwind + React Query + Firebase placeholders (primary focus)
- `server` — Minimal Express scaffold with example endpoints

Follow the README inside each folder to get started.

Quick start (from repository root)

1. Install dependencies for both projects:

	npm run install-all

2. Install the dev tool used by the root scripts:

	npm install

	(This will install `concurrently` defined in the root `package.json`.)

3. Start both servers in development mode from the repo root:

	npm run dev

Or run each project individually:

  cd frontend && npm run dev
  cd server && npm run dev
